This project was to create a data type MarkovModel and implement it in two situations. The MarkovModel data type
is able to represent a markov model of varying order. It was used to generate text using the probability of letters
following other letters, and it was used to decode corrupted text by replacing the corrupted characters with the most
likely character to be in that position.
